# Shopping Cart Application: Additional Features

This document outlines potential enhancements for our shopping cart application. These features aim to improve user experience, security, and the overall functionality of the application.

## User Functionalities

1. **Email Verification on Signup**: Implement a system to verify the user's email address during the signup process. This will help ensure that users provide a valid email and increase the security of our application.

2. **Role Management**: Implement a role management system to control access to different parts of the application. This will allow us to differentiate between regular users, administrators, and other types of users.

3. **User Blocking**: Implement a system to temporarily or permanently block users. This will give us more control over user behavior and help maintain a safe environment for all users.

4. **User Wallet Management**: Implement a user wallet system to manage credits. This will provide a convenient way for users to make purchases within the application.

5. **Payment Gateway Integration**: Integrate a payment gateway to handle transactions. This will allow users to make purchases using various payment methods.

6. **Notification Integration**: Implement email and push notification systems to keep users updated about their orders, promotions, and other relevant information.

## Development and Deployment

1. **Dockerization**: Dockerize the entire project to ensure a consistent development environment and simplify the deployment process.

2. **Git Hooks**: Use Husky to add Git hooks, which will enforce code quality standards before commits and pushes.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions or CircleCI. This will automate the testing and deployment process, ensuring that our application is always in a releasable state.

4. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the application on a cloud service provider like AWS. This will provide a scalable and reliable infrastructure for our application.

5. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: Integrate an APM tool like Datadog or New Relic to monitor the performance of our application. This will provide insights into how our application is performing in real-time, help identify bottlenecks, and assist in troubleshooting and optimizing our application.

By implementing these features, we can enhance the functionality of our shopping cart application, improve user experience, and streamline our development and deployment processes.
