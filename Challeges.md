## Challenges and Decisions

### Challenge 1: Handling Complex Relationships
Description: Managing many-to-many relationships between orders and products required careful planning to ensure data integrity and efficient queries.

Decision: Implement the OrderProduct model as a through table to handle the many-to-many relationship between Order and Product. This allows for additional fields (like amount) in the relationship, providing greater flexibility and detail.

### Challenge 2: Status Management
Description: Keeping track of various statuses for orders and payments in a consistent and maintainable manner was challenging.
Decision: Use Django’s TextChoices to define status enumerations for OrderStatus and PaymentStatus. This approach provides clear, readable, and maintainable status definitions, ensuring consistency across the application.

### Challenge 3: Atomic Transactions
Description: Ensuring that operations involving multiple database changes (like creating an order and its associated payment) are atomic, i.e., either all operations succeed or none do.

Decision: Use Django’s transaction management to ensure atomic operations. For example, wrap complex operations in transaction.atomic() to prevent partial updates in case of errors.

### Challenge 4: Performance Optimization
Description: Managing large datasets and ensuring the application remains performant.

Decision: Optimize database queries using Django’s ORM features like select_related and prefetch_related to reduce the number of queries and improve performance. Additionally, consider indexing frequently queried fields.

### Challenge 5: Data Validation
Description: Ensuring data consistency and validity throughout the application.

Decision: Implement model-level validation and custom validation methods to enforce business rules. Use Django’s form and model validation features to handle validation logic cleanly.

### Challenge 6: Error Handling and Logging
Description: Providing meaningful error messages and logging important events for debugging and monitoring.

Decision: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging using Django’s logging framework. Ensure that critical errors are logged and that users receive clear, actionable error messages.
